# Sorting Visualizer

A real-time sorting visualizer built with `Flutter`, utilizing the `flChart` package for rendering interactive bar charts and `GetX` for efficient state management. This project visualizes four popular sorting algorithms, allowing users to observe the sorting process dynamically.

## Features

- Visualizes sorting algorithms in real-time using bar charts.
- Supports four sorting algorithms:
  - Selection Sort
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
- Interactive user interface built with Flutter.

## Installation

To set up the Sorting Visualizer on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yashcodes/sorting-visualizer.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd sorting-visualizer
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

4. **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## Usage

After running the application, you'll see an interface where you can:

- Select the sorting algorithm you wish to visualize.

- Create an unsorted array by clicking on the reset button. When you navigate to the sorting screen, the unsorted will automatically be created.

- Start the sorting process by clicking on the start button, a sorting indication will be visible there while the array is being sorted and you watch the sorting visualization in real-time.

## Sorting Algorithms

### Selection Sort

**Description**: Selection Sort divides the array into a sorted and an unsorted region. It repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted region and moves it to the sorted region.

### Bubble Sort

**Description**: Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process continues until no swaps are needed.

### Insertion Sort

**Description**: Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one item at a time by comparing each new element to the already sorted elements and inserting it in the correct position.

### Merge Sort

**Description**: Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, sorts them, and merges the sorted halves back together.
